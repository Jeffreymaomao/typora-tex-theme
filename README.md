# tex - a theme for Typora

This repo is designed to emulate the appearance of the default LaTeX article style.

### Usage

1. Download [Release tex.zip file](https://github.com/Jeffreymaomao/typora-tex-theme/releases/latest)
2. Unzip it, you will get
    1. A file: `tex.css`
    2. A folder: `tex`
3. Move/Drag these two things into the Typora themes folder. (see: https://theme.typora.io/doc/Install-Theme/)
4. Reopen the Typora, then choose the theme $\to$ tex.
5. You will get a nice LaTeX-like Typora. (I think...)
